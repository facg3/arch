## 1- Separation of concerns:
#### What kind of tasks are normally handled in the back end, and which are more usually handled in the front end? Why?

## First : What is meant by front end and back end ?

#### Front-end development and back-end development work in tandem to create a website or application for users. In simple terms, front-end development is what is used to create the visual display that the end user of a website experiences. Back-end development is what makes the presentation of front-end development possible. When a user attempts to access an application via the front-end interface, the relevant information is verified via the back-end database, and the proper information is then presented to the user via the back-end Web server.


# - Front-end
### The front end typically includes the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that creates pages, menus, buttons and everything else that forms the basis of what the user sees in his or her Web browser. So someone working as a front-end developer would be familiar with code that focuses on display, and may also have Web design skills with tools like Photoshop.

# - Back-end
### The back end generally includes a Web server that hosts an application (built with code like Node.js, PHP, Python,  Ruby on Rails, C/C#/C++ , .NET, or Java), which communicates with a database (using something like MySQL or Microsoft Access) to serve up the information that the front-end presents. Back-end developers have expertise in building applications that can efficiently locate and deliver data.

## Why we want to separate between front and back end ?
#### As an example of how front-end and back-end systems work together, consider a website that has different content that is accessible to users with different permissions. When a user visits the website and attempts to access a certain page, he or she will be asked to log in; that login information will be authenticated via a database lookup, and then the back-end application communicates with the front end (sometimes via an intermediary program) to display the proper page to the user.
